Welcome to NWheels
=======

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/qcm23727dm8dplk5/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/felix-b/nwheels-bk3vs/branch/master)

Based on our experience, commonality in the needs of enterprise application projects is significantly higher than variability. We take this as an opportunity to slash project costs and timeframes, improve software quality, and reduce technical risks. 

We aim to turn implementation of enterprise applications into an easy win.

## What is NWheels

NWheels is an infrastructural ecosystem and ongoing development effort, which is aimed to implement A-to-Z architectural recipes, supply innovative runtime platform, and provide super-high-productivity framework for development of enterprise applications based on the [.NET Core platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/).

- **What is the problem NWheels solves that makes it an attractive choice for a project?** There are many. Through our experience, we identified a set of typical interrelated challenges and tasks that recur in enterprise software development. NWheels follows field-proven approaches to those, and provides a flexibly structured solution, which is easily adaptable to specific project requirements. [Learn more: optimization opportunities](https://github.com/felix-b/NWheels/wiki/background-optimization-opportunities).

- **What types of applications will be supported?** Web sites, web services, application tiers implemented as micro-services or FaaS; native mobile and desktop apps; CLI programs; data stored in relational, No-SQL, and event-oriented databases. Typical enterprise application includes most of the above. [Learn more: architecture overview](https://github.com/felix-b/NWheels/wiki/architecture-high-level-overview).

- **Where will they run?** Server-side will run on Linux, Windows, macOS; the client side will run as HTML5 apps on web browsers, as native apps on mobile devices, as desktop apps on Windows/Linux/macOS; the client side will also run on less common platforms like Smart TV and IVR.

- **Clouds?** Yes, any compatible IaaS will be supported. NWheels comes with its own runtime platform, and unless explicitly specified, no dependencies on concrete vendor PaaS will be included. Thus for example, mission-critical software will be able to run on Azure with disaster recovery on AWS and Google Cloud.

## License

NWheels is available under the **MIT license**, and is aimed to stay **free forever**.

## Current Status 

#### September 2016 - the concept is proven

NWheels has not yet released its platform for general availability.

The proof-of-concept version named **milestone Afra**, is now stable ([see the demo](https://github.com/felix-b/NWheels/wiki/afra-demo-application)), and serves a basis for two proprietary real-world applications.

> Development of two serious software systems, which we did on top of  NWheels milestone Afra framework, evidenced that it is possible to deliver and maintain a superior working product with less resources by an order of magnitude, compared to competing vendors of similar software.

## Next Step

**Milestone Boda** is now starting with **new greenfield codebase**. 

Why new codebase:
- Target .NET Core (milestone Afra targeted .NET Framework 4.5)
- Fix major deficiencies of milestone Afra:
  - simplify design, implementation, and exposed APIs
  - keep technical debt very low
  - do it TDD way
- Implement improved architecture, based on lessons learned
- Let contributors catch up early

## Call for Contributors

Hi, my name is Felix and I am the inventor of NWheels. My drive to optimize software creation comes from understanding that, as software is going to rule the world, a huge lot of programs will compete for survival. Stable and quick-to-develop will live; unstable or slow-to-develop will die. The ways we create and maintain our software need performance boost and optimization. 

Such optimization can already be seen in how fundamentally operations management has changed over the past decade. It has shifted towards extreme automation and speed, and this process is going to continue. Take a look at [DC/OS](https://dcos.io/), as a vivid example. Servers and programs are now automatically managed by other programs. In DevOps, the Ops game has changed. 

Now what about Dev? Will we follow this shift? I believe we will have to. Those who will spend time re-inventing the wheels and coordinating mega-chaos of big concurrent teams, will lose. When it will come to holding a market share, small teams able to quickly assemble ready building blocks together, and add unique features on top, will be the winners. 

Now we need a platform, which will make it possible.

**The game of enterprise software development has to change. It's time**.

> What will it mean to different people? 
>
> - To developers - more accomplishments for much less effort, and a platform it's fun to work with
> - To architects - more ready building blocks and capabilities, more experimentation for less re-work
> - To software vendors - more competitiveness for less resources, time, and budget
> - To entrepreneurs - more innovation for less investment and risk, shorter time to market
> - To businesses - more reliability and availability of critical services for no cloud vendor lock-in
> - To users - more cool apps and services available

We know for sure that it is doable, because we did it in milestone Afra. Now we want to do it again, this time for real.  

The NWheels project would benefit from contributions by experienced professionals in many different areas.

#### Feel like you would want to get involved? **[Guidelines and instructions link will be available soon]()**.

We believe that code sharing and collaboration, driven by enthusiasm for quality and professionalism, have much better chances of delivering working and (re)usable software, compared to isolated development effort driven by sales plan of a profit-oriented organization. 

## Feature Highlights

NWheels is aimed to exhibit the following characteristics:

#### A-to-Z response to common demand

  - architectural recipes that cover all application layers and tiers: projects are not left to sweat over gluing multiple 3rd-party building blocks together, or re-inventing the wheels
  - ready answers to common requirements and concerns, ranging from basic features like authorization, to advanced scenarios like elastic scalability
  - built-in support for DevOps procedures, automation of clouds, and easy integration with application lifecycle management

#### Get significantly more for doing much less. For example:

  - scaffold a new application - and have it automatically built, deployed, and monitored on cloud or on premises environments, where the only piece that is missing, is the unique features you are going to develop.
  - write code of domain model, logic, and conceptual UI - and get whole layers of your system automatically implemented by conventions - including data persistence, CLI, and UI apps bound to the domain model, in-process or through invocations of REST/backend APIs.
  - use Information Security building block domain - and get user account management, authentication, and common user stories such as  'confirm email' and 'change password', working out of the box.
  - define access control rules for different user profiles - and have them transparently enforced through all application layers, including access to both operations and data, in both vertical and horizontal slicing.
  - define semantic logging messages - and get automatic metric collection, thresholds, circuit breakers, and alerts.

#### Proven architectures, approaches, and patterns, for dramatically less effort on your side. To name a few:

  - hexagonal architecture 
  - micro-services
  - domain-driven design
  - command-line interface over application functions
  - distributed consensus and service discovery
  - containerization

#### Innovative approaches
  - convention over implementation - transparent implementation of abstractions by pipelines of pluggable conventions - an approach, which eliminates majority of repetitive mechanical code from your codebase.
  - unobtrusive customization - multiple reusable orthogonal adaptations are stacked on top of white-label version. Plugged into customer-specific configurations, the adaptations extend and alter domain model, logic, and conceptual UI, while the white-label version remains unchanged. 
  - late compilation - model-based components are late-compiled against customized models and concrete technology stacks
  - building block domains - adaptive and reusable models, logic, and conceptual UI parts for common domains, such as e-commerce, CRM, booking, accounting.

#### Platform at your service
  - runs on premises and on any cloud with compatible IaaS; no dependency on specific cloud vendor PaaS - no vendor lock-in
  - communication endpoints, backend APIs, messaging, workflows, rule engines, distributed cache, map/reduce, job scheduling, ... 
  - elastic on-demand scalability and automatic failover
  - cloud, hybrid, and on-premise deployments
  - pluggable automation of underlying platforms, e.g. Docker, DC/OS, cloud vendor APIs

#### Ready DevOps/ALM toolchain
  - automated deployment to dev boxes and test/prod environments on premise, hybrid, and on cloud
  - runtime health monitoring, metric collection, and tools for production intelligence
  - continuous deployment and continuous integration with optional developer git flow, personal builds, and gated commits
  - product and agile process management
  - all of the above is cross-tracked for maximal visibility and decision support
