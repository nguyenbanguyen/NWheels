# Contributing guidelines

## First-timers

Contributing to an open source project for the first time can be hard and little overwhelming. Here we are trying to simplify this first step, and provide all the information you may need. 

A good point to start is issues labelled `first-timers`.

## Choosing what to work on

If you don't know what to work on, please go to the current Project (it is a Scrum board), and pick an issue from the `TODO` column.

We use message thread in the issues for communicating everything related to it. Please make sure you pass through the existing communication first. 

If you decide to start working on an issue, please leave a comment stating that. We will then assign the issue to you.  

## Propose a new change


First discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.
