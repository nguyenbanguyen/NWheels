# Contributing guidelines

## First-timers

Contributing to an open source project for the first time can be hard and little overwhelming. Here we attempt to make this first step easier, and provide all the information you may need.  

A good point to start is looking for issues labeled `first-timers`.

## Choosing what to work on

If you don't know what to work on, please go to the current Project (it is a Scrum board), and pick an issue from the `TODO` column.

We use message thread of the issue for all related communication. Please make sure you pass through this thread first. 

If you decide to start working on an issue, please leave a comment stating that. Make sure no one left such comment already. We will then assign the issue to you.  

## Proposing a new change

If you have a new idea for which you can't find an existing issue, you are welcome to suggest it. 

Start by discussing the idea with us on Slack at nwheels.slack.com. 

- If you aren't yet member of our NWheels team on Slack, please send and email to felixberman76@gmail.com, stating you'd like to join. We will email back an invitation.
